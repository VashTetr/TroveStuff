# TroveStuff
Stuff made by me for Trove.
Free to use for everyone if you mention my name.

## AntiCrash Trove
Pretty simple Script. Current state not usable with the Steam version of Trove. If you still want to use it for steam, you'll need to adjust it.

## AntiAFK ShipDestroyers
AntiAFK Script made by A Friend of mine and me for "ShipDestroyers". 
- Perfect for AFK clearing ships or just being afk in 5farms.
- works in background

## instructions
- Rebind your attack slot to m and the second attack to o (or you cant use it)

## Trove Mod Migration Tool
Pretty straight forward
1. Install Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Put the mod folder and ModCfgs folder in the same directory as the script
3. open the Script and choose your trove version :)
